## Introduction
This is a basic application that provides all the weather and places to go
when searching and exploring the main cities of Japan.

## Guide
In order to run the app smoothly, please follow these few guidelines:
* Open the app's directory
* Next is to rename the ".env.example" file to ".env" (env variables are already configured within the **.env.example** file).
* Open any cli and change the directory to the application's folder
* Lastly, run the **php artisan serve** command in the CLI in order to start our basic server/host
* Now, just access the app through **localhost:8000/** or use the custom port indicated when running the **serve** command


## UI and UX Implementation
For me this is one of the best approach to create an app that will help travellers.
The UI is pretty compact and easy to navigate, giving users more time to explore more of
the content of the app.

It also provides straightforward functionalities which makes it a user-friendly app.
I also used the SPA (Single Page Application) concept which makes the app more efficient
and gives quick responses.

## Code Implementation
The code is pretty neat and uses a modular concept, in case a bug occurs, it can easily
be tracked because of the modulation of classes.

The code structure follows the majority of coding conventions in order to unify with the
standard writing and designing of codes. It also follows the OOP principles in order to
efficiently design the structure of codes.

By native, Laravel uses the MVC architecture, which also can be seen in the code structure
to easily follow the flow of each execution.

Overall, the code structure is the best approach that we can implement in an application.

## Remarks
For any concerns, suggestions or any difficulties accessing the repository or running the
application, please don't hesitate to contact me.
